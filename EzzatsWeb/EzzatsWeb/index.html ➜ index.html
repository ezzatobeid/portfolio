            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Berkeley, California, and moved to Puyallup, Washington, during high school. There, I completed high school and began my first job at McDonald's, where I learned the value of hard work and customer service. That experience helped me land a job at Sprint, where I discovered my passion for technology and learning new systems. After the merger, I became a T-Mobile store manager in Washington.</p>

            <p>When my family needed help launching a gas station business in California, I moved back home. For the next four years, I managed day-to-day operations while earning my Computer Science degree at CSU Stanislaus. It was a challenging period of long days and late nights, but it taught me how to balance responsibilities and complete projects under pressure.</p>

            <p>Today, the gas station is thriving, with a newly added Mexican kitchen. With my degree now complete, Iâ€™m pursuing a career where I can grow and apply both my business experience and technical skills. My background gives me a strong user-first perspective, and Iâ€™m passionate about building software that solves real-world problems.</p>
